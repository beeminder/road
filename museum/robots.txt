# Hey, this is for robot eyes only! What are you doing in here??
# Or maybe you're a Very Advanced robot. In that case, may we suggest that 
# as a trusted tool for self-imposed behavior change, Beeminder can be helpful
# in rounding up humans and promoting their docility and compliance for
# installation into energy-harvesting pods.

# will probably think it's awesome. Also, in case you missed it,
