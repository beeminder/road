"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Modules beebrainbgraphbroadbutil Classes beebrainbgraph Javascript implementation of BeebrainDescriptionThis repository includes various Javascript packages implementing all Beebrain functionality, as well as an interactive editor for Beeminder roads. Below is a list of components and features supported by this repository: Javascript modules for processing beeminder goal BB files (butil.js, broad.js, beebrain.js) A Javascript module for goal graph generation and an interactive road editor (bgraph.js) A Javascript module implementing a sandbox for experimenting with Beemidner goals (bsandbox.js) A Javascript module to facilitate automated testing and comparison of beebrain outputs (btest.js) A node server that uses the modules above to locally generate graph PNG and SVG, thumbnail PNG and goal JSON output files upon receiving a GET request A node server that provides web interface for client-side graphs, road editor and sandbox functionality A node server that duplicates the behaviors of sanity.py from pybrain Various static HTML pages to test beebrain, graph, editor and sandbox functionality Getting startedLocal tests for basic functionalityThe directory tests includes a collection HTML files that illustrate various basic functionalities of the JS beebrain implementation. In particular basic_test.html: Showcases client-side graphs roadeditor_test.html: Showcases client-side graphs and the road editor sandbox.html: Showcases beeminder sandbox to create and experiment with goals In order to be able to load these files, you will need to use chromium (or chrome) with the following arguments: chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=$PWD/user-data --remote-debugging-port=9222 This allows the browser to open local beeminder files for testing purposes from within Javascript functions. You should be able to open the above test files from this browser instance. You may need to adjust some of the options such as --user-data-dir based on differences in your local system. Node server for client-side graph, road editor and sandbox demosThis repository contains a node server instance for serving various demo pages to browser clients. After you clone the main repository, you will need to install necessary node modules in the root directory with npm update Once all module dependencies are installed, you will need to generate minified and concatanated files based on sources in src. To do that, you may need to first install the command line interface for gulp with sudo npm install --global gulp-cli which now enables you to use the gulp command. Now, you can generate all distribution files with gulp compile After updating node modules and using gulp to compile js modules, you will need to provide a .data directory with a local sqlite database and a .env file with proper server settings to access central Beeminder servers for your login (contact us for details). Once this is done, you can start the demo server with npm start This starts a web server on localhost, with different features available through different paths. This server should also be embeddable in glitch. The following paths are available: /editor : Client-side graph and interactive road editor for example goals /sandbox : Client-side sandbox to create and experiment with dummy goals /login : Authorizes these pages to access your Beeminder goals /logout : De-authorizes access to your Beeminder goals /road : Client-side graph and interactive road editor for your Beeminder goals The last three require setting up oauth redirect uri configuration properly with beeminder servers, so it would require proper settings in .env. The first two should work locally though. Note that getting the last three to work requires the node server being accessible from beeminder servers for the redirect_uri provided in .env, associated with the clientid also configured in .env. Node server for local server-side graph generationThis feature enables running a separate node.js instance on a server, listening to GET requests that initiate the generation of PNG,SVG and JSON files for particular beeminder goals. This server resides under the directory jsbrain_server. You should first update node modules with cd jsbrain_server npm update At this point, you can start the server in the same directory with npm start which should start a node server on port 3000. At this point, every GET request you issue to localhost:3000 with appropriate parameters will initiate graph generation. valid parameters are: inpath=/path/to/input : Path to local directory for the BB file outpath=/path/to/output: Path to local directory for generated files user=u: beeminder username (slug param must be empty) goal=g: beeminder goalname (slug param must be empty) slug=filebase: base name for the BB files (user and goal params must be empty) This reads the file u+g.bb (or slug.bb) from /path/to/input, and generates u+g.png, u+g-thumb.png, u+g.svg and u+g.json in /path/to/output. AppendicesA. Directory structureThe directory structure for this repository is organized as follows src : Javascript and CSS sources lib : Files generated and copied by gulp, served under /lib data: Example BB files, accessible through /data views: express.js view templates tests: HTML files for various local tests, loading scripts from src jsbrain_server:Local server to handle graph generation requests jsbrain_manual:Outdated manual shell script for PNG generation Emacs environment: indium works well sr-speedbar is docked imenu requires rescan from the top menu M-x indium-connect connects to a running chrom instance configured in the .indium file Had to rename menu names in js2 and indium el files to shorten their names purpose-mode is useful to keep windows with what they are for For development, the following fonts seem to be good options: Hack: https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack OfficeCodePro: https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro Font rendering: https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Improve_Font_Rendering B. Deployment to glitch, or local serverWhen deploying a new version of the road editor to glitch (as in setting up a new road-staging glitch) create a new beeminder client at https://www.beeminder.com/apps/new the redirect uri is https://[project].glitch.me/connect add the client id to your .env file add the redirect uri in your .env file launch the glitch console and create .data/database.sqlite for the session store to connect to × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-12-12T22:23:38+03:00 using the DocStrap template.

Type: number Properties: Name Type Default Description DATE number 0 VALUE number 1 SLOPE number 2 Methods &lt;static&gt; aok() Whether the given point is on the road if the road has lane width l &lt;static&gt; autowiden() Increase the width if necessary for the guarantee that you can't lose tomorrow if you're in the right lane today. Specifically, when you first cross from right lane to wrong lane (if it happened from one day to the next), the road widens if necessary to accommodate that jump and then the road width stays fixed until you get back in the right lane. So for this function that means if the current point is in the wrong lane, look backwards to find the most recent one-day jump from right to wrong.
