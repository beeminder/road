When disabled, the generated graph mirrors beebrain output as closely as possible. divJSON object Binds the goal JSON output to a div element divGraph object Binds the graph to a div element svgSize object Size of the SVG element to hold the graph e.g. { width: 700, height: 450 } focusRect object Boundaries of the SVG group to hold the focus graph e.g. { x:0, y:0, width:700, height: 370 } focusPad object Initial padding within the focus graph e.g. { left:25, right:5, top:25, bottom:30 } ctxRect object Boundaries of the SVG group to hold the context graph e.g. { x:0, y:370, width:700, height: 80 } ctxPad object Initial padding within the context graph e.g. { left:25, right:5, top:0, bottom:30 } scrollZoom Boolean Enables zooming by scrollwheel. When disabled, only the context graph and the zoom buttons will allow zooming. showContext Boolean Enables the display of the context graph within the SVG showFocusRect Boolean Enables showing a dashed rectange in the context graph visualizing the current graph limits on the y-axis keepSlopes Boolean Indicates whether slopes for segments beyond the currently dragged element should be kept constant during editing. keepIntervals Boolean Indicates whether intervals between the knots for segments beyond the currently dragged element should be kept constant during editing. showData Boolean Enables displaying datapoints on the graph maxDataDays Integer When datapoint display is enabled, indicates the number of days before asof to show data for. This can be used to speed up display refresh for large goals. Choose -1 to display all datapoints. Choose -1 to show all points. maxFutureDays Integer Indicates how many days beyond asof should be included in the fully zoomed out graph. This is useful for when the goal date is too far beyond asof, making the context graph somewhat useless in terms of its interface utility. divTable object Binds the road table to a div element tableHeight Number Height of the road matrix table. Choose 0 for unspecified tableCheckboxes Boolean Chooses whether the road matrix table should include checkboxes for choosing the field to be automatically computed. reverseTable Boolean Indicates whether the road matrix table should be shown with the earliest rows first (normal) or most recent rows first(reversed). tableAutoScroll Boolean Indicates whether the auto-scrolling feature for the road matrix table should be enabled such that when the mouse moves over knots, dots or road elements, the corresponding table row is scrolled to be visible in the table. This is particularly useful when tableHeight is explicitly specified and is nonzero. tableUpdateOnDrag Boolean Chooses whether the road matrix table should be dynamically updated during the dragging of road knots, dots and segments. Enabling this may induce some lagginess, particularly on Firefox due to more components being updated during dragging onRoadChange function Callback function that gets invoked when the road is edited by the user. Various interface functions can then be used to retrieve the new road state. This is also useful to update the state of undo/redo and submit buttons based on how many edits have been done on the original road. onError function Callback function that gets invoked when an error is encountered in loading, processing, drawing or editing the road. zoomButton object Visual parameters for the zoom in/out buttons. \"factor\" indicates how much to zoom in/out per click. e.g. { size: 40, opacity: 0.6, factor: 1.5 } bullsEye object Size of the bullseye image in the focus and context graphs e.g. { size: 40, ctxsize: 20 } roadDot object Visual parameters for draggable road dots e.g. { size: 5, ctxsize: 3, border: 1.5, ctxborder: 1 } roadKnot object Visual parameters for draggable road knots and removal buttons e.g. { width: 3, rmbtnscale: 0.6 } roadLine object Visual parameters for draggable road lines e.g. { width: 3, ctxwidth: 2 } oldRoadLine object Visual parameters for fixed lines for the original road e.g. { width: 3, ctxwidth: 2, dash: 32, ctxdash: 16 } dataPoint object Visual parameters for data points (past, flatlined and hollow) e.g. { size: 5, fsize: 5, hsize: 2.5 } horizon object Visual parameters for the akrasia horizon e.g. { width: 2, ctxwidth: 1, dash: 8, ctxdash: 6, font: 12, ctxfont: 9 } today object Visual parameters for vertical line for asof e.g. { width: 2, ctxwidth: 1, font: 12, ctxfont: 9 } watermark object Visual parameters for watermarks e.g. { height:170, fntsize:130 } guidelines object Visual parameters for guidelines e.g. { width:2, weekwidth:4 } textBox object Visual parameters for text boxes shown during dragging e.g. { margin: 3 } odomReset object Visual parameters for odometer resets e.g. { width: 0.5, dash: 8 } roadLineCol object Colors for road segments for the editor, e.g. { valid: \"black\", invalid:\"#ca1212\", selected:\"yellow\"} roadDotCol object Colors for the road dots for the editor, e.g. { fixed: \"darkgray\", editable:\"#c2c2c2\", selected: \"yellow\"} roadKnotCol object Colors for the road knots (vertical) for the editor, e.g. { dflt: \"#c2c2c2\", selected: \"yellow\", rmbtn: \"black\", rmbtnsel: \"red\"} textBoxCol object Colors for text boxes e.g. { bg: \"#ffffff\", stroke:\"#d0d0d0\"} roadTableCol object Colors for the road table e.g. { bg:\"#ffffff\", bgHighlight: \"#fffb55\", text:\"#000000\", textDisabled: \"#aaaaaa\", bgDisabled:\"#f2f2f2\"} dataPointCol object Colors for datapoints, e.g. { future: \"#909090\", stroke: \"lightgray\"} halfPlaneCol object Colors for the yellow brick half plane. e.g. { fill: \"#ffffe8\" } pastBoxCol object Colors for the past, e.g. { fill: \"#f8f8f8\", opacity:0.5 } odomResetCol object Colors for odometer reset indicators, e.g. { dflt: \"#c2c2c2\" } GoalProperties Type: object Properties: Name Type Description offred Boolean Whether to use yesterday-is-red criteria for derails yaw Boolean Which side of the YBR you want to be on, +1 or -1 dir Boolean Which direction you'll go (usually same as yaw) kyoom Boolean Cumulative; plot vals as the sum of those entered so far odom Boolean Treat zeros as accidental odom resets noisy Boolean Compute road width based on data, not just road rate integery Boolean Whether vals are necessarily integers monotone Boolean Whether data is necessarily monotone aggday String sum/last/first/min/max/mean/median/mode/trimmean/jolly GoalVisuals Type: object Properties: Name Type Description plotall Boolean Plot all points instead of just the aggregated point steppy Boolean Join dots with purple steppy-style line rosy Boolean Show the rose-colored dots and connecting line movingav Boolean Show moving average line superimposed on the data aura Boolean Show blue-green/turquoise aura/swath hidey Boolean Whether to hide the y-axis numbers stathead Boolean Whether to include label with stats at top of graph hashtags Boolean Show annotations on graph for hashtags in comments × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2019-01-12T23:43:53+03:00 using the DocStrap template.

"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Modules beebrainbgraphbroadbsandboxbutil Classes beebrainbgraphbsandbox Tutorials Using the beebrain classUsing the bgraph class Global Global Javascript implementation of BeebrainDescriptionThis repository includes various Javascript packages implementing all Beebrain functionality, as well as an interactive editor for Beeminder roads. Below is a list of components and features supported by this repository: Javascript modules for processing beeminder goal BB files (butil, broad, beebrain) A Javascript module for goal graph generation and an interactive road editor (bgraph) A Javascript module implementing a sandbox for experimenting with Beemidner goals (bsandbox) A Javascript module to facilitate automated testing and comparison of beebrain outputs (btest) A node server that uses the modules above to locally generate graph PNG and SVG, thumbnail PNG and goal JSON output files upon receiving a GET request A node server that provides web interface for client-side graphs, road editor and sandbox functionality A node server that duplicates the behaviors of sanity.py from pybrain Various static HTML pages to test beebrain, graph, editor and sandbox functionality Getting startedLocal tests for basic functionalityThe directory tests includes a collection HTML files that illustrate various basic functionalities of the JS beebrain implementation. In particular basic_test.html: Showcases client-side graphs roadeditor_test.html: Showcases client-side graphs and the road editor sandbox.html: Showcases beeminder sandbox to create and experiment with goals In order to be able to load these files, you will need to use chromium (or chrome) with the following arguments: chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=$HOME/jsgraph-data --remote-debugging-port=9222 --use-gl=osmesa This allows the browser to open local beeminder files for testing purposes from within Javascript functions. You should be able to open the above test files from this browser instance. You may need to adjust some of the options such as --user-data-dir based on differences in your local system. Node server for client-side graph, road editor and sandbox demosThis repository contains a node server instance for serving various demo pages to browser clients. After you clone the main repository, you will need to install necessary node modules in the root directory with npm update Once all module dependencies are installed, you will need to generate minified and concatanated files based on sources in src. To do that, you may need to first install the command line interface for gulp with sudo npm install --global gulp-cli which now enables you to use the gulp command. Now, you can generate all distribution files with gulp compile After updating node modules and using gulp to compile js modules, you will need to provide a .data directory with a local sqlite database and a .env file with proper server settings to access central Beeminder servers for your login (contact us for details). Once this is done, you can start the demo server with npm start This starts a web server on localhost, with different features available through different paths. This server should also be embeddable in glitch. The following paths are available: /editor : Client-side graph and interactive road editor for example goals /sandbox : Client-side sandbox to create and experiment with dummy goals /login : Authorizes these pages to access your Beeminder goals /logout : De-authorizes access to your Beeminder goals /road : Client-side graph and interactive road editor for your Beeminder goals The last three require setting up oauth redirect uri configuration properly with beeminder servers, so it would require proper settings in .env. The first two should work locally though. Note that getting the last three to work requires the node server being accessible from beeminder servers for the redirect_uri provided in .env, associated with the clientid also configured in .env. Node server for local server-side graph generationThis feature enables running a separate node.js instance on a server, listening to GET requests that initiate the generation of PNG,SVG and JSON files for particular beeminder goals. This server resides under the directory jsbrain_server. You should first update node modules with cd jsbrain_server npm update At this point, you can start the server in the same directory with npm start which should start a node server on port 3000. At this point, every GET request you issue to localhost:3000 with appropriate parameters will initiate graph generation. valid parameters are: inpath=/path/to/input : Path to local directory for the BB file outpath=/path/to/output: (optional) Path to local directory for generated files user=u: beeminder username (slug param must be empty) goal=g: beeminder goalname (slug param must be empty) slug=filebase: base name for the BB files (user and goal params must be empty) pyjson=/path/to/pyout/slug.json: (optional) Local path to pybrain JSON output This reads the file u+g.bb (or slug.bb) from /path/to/input, and generates u+g.png, u+g-thumb.png, u+g.svg and u+g.json in /path/to/output.

"},"tutorial-beebrain_.html":{"id":"tutorial-beebrain_.html","title":"Tutorial: Using the beebrain class","body":" Documentation Modules beebrainbgraphbroadbsandboxbutil Classes beebrainbgraphbsandbox Tutorials Using the beebrain classUsing the bgraph class Global Global Using the beebrain class This tutorial describes the details and usage of the beebrain class provided as part of the Beeminder Javascript implementation. The beebrain module and the associated beebrain class allows anyone to load and process a beeminder goal file (aka BB file), which includes goal configuration information, as well as the associated road matrix and datapoints. Assuming that the required modules (moment, polyfit, butil, broad and beebrain) are preloaded, the following code illustrates the most basic usage &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; async function loadGoal() { let url=\"file:///path/file.bb\" var resp = await butil.loadJSON( url ) document.getElementById('bbjson').innerHTML=JSON.stringify(resp) let goalbb = new beebrain( resp ) let goalout = goalbb.getStats() document.getElementById('outjson').innerHTML=JSON.stringify(goalout) } loadGoal()Assuming that there are two div elements with ids bbjson and outjson, this script fills in their contents with the loaded BB file, as well as the beebrain output. Note that the beebrain constructor needs to be called with a javascript object with the contents of the BB file acquired through beebrain#getStats. Note that the same module can be used within a node server as well. The following code (assuming paths are adjusted to work with your setup and required dependencies are installed) should work with a node server: const fs = require('fs') const bu = require('butil.js') const br = require('broad.js') const bb = require('beebrain.js') var bbjson = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(testroad.bb', 'utf8')) var bbr = new bb(bbjson) console.log(bbr.getStats())Once the beebrain object is created, various internal variables are directly exposed as public members for efficiency. In particular, the following members may be useful: roads : Piecewise linear road representation. The format for this object is an array of linear segments, each of which is an object with the following format: {sta: [t, v], end: [t, v], slope: r, auto: autoparam}, where r is expressed in Hertz (1/s), and autoparam is one of the enumerated values in broad.RP, indicating which entry will be auto-computed. Note that the end point for one segment is required to be identical to the starting point for the next segment. Finally, initial and final flat segments are added during processing, 100 days before and after the initial and final road matrix components, respectively. goal : Goal parameters and computed details. This is a javascript object with all goal parameters and computed statistics as well as a number of internal computations. data : Aggregated (non-future) data points for each day with at least one entry, where each array element has the form [unixtime,aggvalue,comment,type,prevt,prevv,voriginal], where type is one of the values in beebrain.DPTYPE, prevt and prevv are the time and value of the previous data point (used to draw the steppy lines) and voriginal records the unmodified (e.g. non-cumulative) value of the datapoint (set to null when the aggregated value does not coincide with any of the manually entered data points). The last element is used by module:bgraph to display tooltips for datapoints with the originally entered data value. Note that this format is also used in beebrain#alldata and beebrain#rosydata with slight differences. fuda : \"Future\" data points, beyond \"today\" (i.e. asof). Has the same format as beebrain.data. alldata : An array of all data points entered by the user, where each entry is an array [unixtime,vtotal,comment,type,null,null,voriginal]. Fields have the same semantics as beebrain#data, except that the \"previous\" point is not defined and hence not recorded. Includes future data as well. rosydata : \"Rosy\" datapoints generated from aggregated data points. Each array entry has the form [unixtime,aggval_comment,type,prevt,prevv,voriginal]. Fields have the same semantics as beebrain#data, including the time and value of the previous point used to generate lines connecting the rosy dots. flad : Flatlined (predicted) data point for today. Has the format [unixtime, vppr, \"PPR\", DPTYPE.FLATLINE, prevt, prevv, null]. allvals : Set of values for each non-empty timestamp. For a given unixtime t, allvals[t] contains an array with entries of the form [vtotal, comment, voriginal]. oresets : Array of unix timestamps where odometer reset was performed derails : Array of unix timestamps where the goal derailed These variables should be only used in a read-only manner since their internal consistency is critical for other components of the Beeminder's Javascript library. An exception to this is the roads object, which can be edited externally, followed by a call to beebrain#reloadRoad(). This forces the beebrain object to reprocess the goal with the new road and update its output and internal state. Finally, if one wants to directly change the current road matrix for this particular beebrain instance, this can be done by using the beebrain#setRoadObj method. This is often useful to keep two bgraph instances on the same web page consistent and synchronized. However, this is normally done through associated bgraph instances and not through beebrain instances. InternalsThe inner workings of the beebrain class closely mirror those of the python implementation of beebrain. The constructor first defines all private variables and methods, exported public functions and then calls the genStats() function. This function performs all goal processing to generate goal stats. Important functions (in calling order) are legacyIn(p) : Processes legacy parameters stampIn(p,d) : Performs timestamp conversion for inputs vetParams() : Verifies parameter sanity procData() : Processes datapoints procRoad() : Processes the road matrix and constructs the internal roads object computeRosy() : Pre-computes rosy datapoints stampOut(p) : Prepares timestamp values for output legacyOut(p) : Outputs legacy parameters There are of course numerous details on how and when various things are computed.
