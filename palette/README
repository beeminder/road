Instructions for when new colors are used in graphs

1. Add images that showcase all the colors to js_montage.png (it should be a montage of production output because it factors in anti-aliasing and intermediate colors)
2. Open that in Gimp
3. Under "image", go to "mode" and pick "indexed"
4. That should allow you to generate an indexed version with 256 colors with an optimized palette
5. Save that as jsbrain_server/palette.png
6. Now the Beebrain server will use it to generate nice png files
