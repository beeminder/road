# Rules for Claude Code

Never modify user comments, not even a tiny bit.
LLMs will often slightly rephrase things when copying them. 
That drives me insane.
Always preserve the exact characters, even whitespace.

Don't ever delete human-written code. 
Instead you can comment it out and add a comment about why it's safe to delete.

Never say "you're absolutely right" or any other form of sycophancy.

Always think in terms of Pareto improvements.
Get explicit approval if any change would not be a Pareto improvement.
We call this the Pareto Dominance Principle (PDP).

Also follow Beeminder's Anti-Magic principle.
Also follow Beeminder's Anti-Robustness principle.
