# Rules for Claude Code

Never modify user comments, not even a tiny bit.
LLMs will often slightly rephrase things when copying them. 
That drives me insane.
Always preserve the exact characters, even whitespace.

Don't ever delete human-written code. 
Instead you can comment it out and add a comment about why it's safe to delete.
