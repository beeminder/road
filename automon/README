Automon (as in "automatically monitor", pronounced "Ottomon" and previously
known as cmonitor) is a testing utility that runs every time a source file 
changes and alerts you if the output of any of the Beebrain test files changed.
By default it compares all the JSON output from running Beebrain on a .bb file
and can even compare the graph images and show an image diff if anything
changed.

Whenever we find a new bug we should put the .bb file in the private suite --
github.com/beeminder/privatesuite -- and create a gissue pointing to it. It 
should then stay in the test suite forever to serve as a regression test.

It works by storing baseline output files in the data/jsref directory. Every
time automon runs it puts the latest output in data/jsout and alerts you if
anything changed.

*Important*: jsbrain_server needs to be running!


The simplest usage is 

./automon.py data

which goes through the bb files in the 'data' directory and generates reference 
outputs (if they don't already exist) for these inputs. Subsequently, it 
periodically wakes up and regenerates the output files, comparing them with the 
reference outputs and alerting the user when differences are detected.

Alternatively, instead of periodic polling, automon can monitor multiple 
directories for any changes to the files inside to trigger reprocessing of bb 
files. For example:

./automon.py -w ../road/src -w data data

monitors both the jsbrain source files and the bb files in the data
directory to trigger reprocessing. If watch directories are specified,
periodic polling cannot be used.
