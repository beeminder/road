Automon (as in "automatically monitor", pronounced "Ottomon") is a testing 
utility that watches the directory the source code is in and runs tests whenever
any source file changes. It tests every .bb file in a given directory and sounds
an alert if the JSON output or the graph image change from their stored
reference states. It even shows a visual diff of the graph images if the images
change.

Whenever we find a new bug we should put the .bb file in the private suite --
github.com/beeminder/privatesuite -- and create a gissue pointing to it. It 
should then stay in the test suite forever to serve as a regression test.

Automon works by storing baseline output files in the data/jsref directory, 
assuming "data" is the specified test suite directory. Every time Automon runs 
it puts the latest output in data/jsout.

*Important*: jsbrain_server needs to be running!

The simplest usage is 

./automon.py data

which goes through the .bb files in the 'data' directory and generates reference
outputs (if they don't already exist) for these inputs. It then does that again
every time TODO
then periodically 
wakes up and regenerates the output files, comparing them with the reference 
outputs and making noise if it detects differences.

Alternatively, instead of periodic polling, automon can monitor multiple 
directories for any changes to the files inside to trigger reprocessing of bb 
files. For example:

./automon.py -w ../road/src -w data data

monitors both the jsbrain source files and the bb files in the data
directory to trigger reprocessing. If watch directories are specified,
periodic polling cannot be used.
