Automon (as in "automatically monitor", pronounced "Ottomon") is a testing 
utility for Beebrain that watches the directory the source code is in and runs
quals whenever any source file changes. It qualifies every .bb file in a given
directory and sounds an alert if the JSON output or the graph image change from
their stored reference states. It even shows a visual diff of the graph images
if the images change.

Whenever we find a new bug, the protocol is that we put the .bb file in the 
private suite -- github.com/beeminder/privatesuite -- and create a gissue 
pointing to it. It should then stay in the qual suite (aka test suite) forever
to serve as a regression qual.

Automon works by storing baseline output files in the data/jsref directory, 
assuming "data" is the specified qual suite directory. Every time Automon runs 
it puts the latest output in data/jsout.
[TODO: change those to bbref and bbout]

*Important*: jsbrain_server needs to be running!

The simplest usage is 

./automon.py data

which goes through the .bb files in the 'data' directory and generates reference
outputs, if they don't already exist, for these inputs. If they do exist it
makes (literal) noise if it detects differences.

Automon can monitor multiple directories for any changes to the files inside to
trigger reprocessing of the bb files. For example:

./automon.py data ../road/src

monitors both the Beebrain source files and the bb files in the data directory
to trigger reprocessing.
