bug-d-pocket: zoom to 2016-11-28 -> 2017-05-03 and observe weird graph artifacts
bug-d-bump: static graph doesn't show centerline of YBR

FIXED (Missing BDUSK, making dtd take forever): bug-meta-pledged causes the browser to hang
FIXED (Uluc's dumb sorting mistake):bug-d-mmuvi has an extra segment in the purple line at the bottom left of the static graph
FIXED (stable sort): bugroad1 has the datapoints under the road, contrary to bmndr.com/d/push
FIXED: bugroad2 has the bullseye too early, contrary to bmndr.com/d/meta
